## Prompt:
is there a rule for photographs of pairs of humans,
which gender (male/female) should be on which side (left/right)?
maybe based on some occult/alchemistic "rule" like "female = feminine = left-hand-path"?

## Response:
That‚Äôs a fascinating question ‚Äî and you‚Äôre right that there are both **symbolic** and **practical** traditions about this.

Let‚Äôs break it down into **three layers** ‚Äî symbolic (occult/alchemical), artistic/compositional, and cultural/habitual:

* * *

### üúç 1. Symbolic / Occult / Alchemical Layer

In many **esoteric** or **symbolic systems**, the _left_ and _right_ sides are not neutral ‚Äî they have distinct meanings that sometimes tie into gender polarity.

| Concept | Left | Right |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alchemy / Hermeticism | _Luna_, feminine, passive, receptive | _Sol_, masculine, active, projective |
| Kabbalah / Tree of Life | Pillar of Severity (Binah, female) | Pillar of Mercy (Chokmah, male) |
| Taoism | Yin (female, dark, moon, left) | Yang (male, light, sun, right) |
| Occult "Hand" Symbolism | Left-hand path ‚Üí lunar, intuitive, inward | Right-hand path ‚Üí solar, rational, outward |

So in **esoteric or symbolic imagery**, it‚Äôs not uncommon to place:

*   **The woman on the left (viewer‚Äôs left)** ‚Üí to embody the _feminine_, lunar, receptive principle.
*   **The man on the right (viewer‚Äôs right)** ‚Üí to embody the _masculine_, solar, active principle.

That‚Äôs the same polarity you find in old alchemical plates ‚Äî the _coniunctio_ (sacred marriage) often shows the **Queen (Luna)** on the left and the **King (Sol)** on the right.

* * *

### üé® 2. Artistic / Photographic Conventions

In **portrait composition**, however, things can reverse for aesthetic balance or social convention.

*   In **classical portraiture**, the man is often placed on the **left (viewer‚Äôs left)** ‚Äî historically symbolizing his ‚Äúdominant‚Äù or ‚Äúprotective‚Äù position beside the woman (especially in couples or wedding photography).
*   In **wedding photos**, for example, the traditional rule (Western) is:
    *   _From the viewer‚Äôs perspective:_ the **man stands on the left**, the **woman on the right**.
    *   _From their perspective (facing the audience):_ the man‚Äôs **right arm** is free to draw his sword (a medieval custom when escorting a lady on the left side).

So you can see how **symbolic polarity** and **social convention** actually point in _opposite_ directions.

* * *

### ‚öñÔ∏è 3. How to Reconcile These

If you‚Äôre deliberately composing a **symbolic or ritual-style** photo, you could:

*   Put the **female figure on the left (Luna)** and **male on the right (Sol)** ‚Äî aligning with alchemical or esoteric polarity.
*   Optionally reinforce it with visual cues: silver/moonlight vs. gold/sunlight tones, curved vs. angular poses, etc.

If you‚Äôre composing a **traditional or formal** photo (wedding, social), the norm is reversed ‚Äî **male left, female right**.

* * *

**Summary Table**

| Context | Female | Male |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alchemical / Esoteric | Left (Luna, Yin) | Right (Sol, Yang) |
| Western Social / Wedding | Right | Left |
| Artistic Freedom | Whichever side balances composition or emotion |  |

* * *

Would you like me to show a visual comparison (like two mock compositions showing the esoteric vs. traditional placement)?

Is this conversation helpful so far?
